# Decides whether a PR's diff should be put through the Security Scan.
# Called by .github/workflows/security-gate.yml.
#
# We scan UNTRUSTED authors and skip trusted ones. "Trusted" is GitHub's
# native author_association: OWNER / MEMBER / COLLABORATOR -- people with a
# direct relationship to the repo/org -- OR an author in the MAINTAINERS list.
# The list covers maintainers whose org membership is PRIVATE: GitHub only
# reports MEMBER in author_association when membership is public, so a private
# maintainer shows up as CONTRIBUTOR and would otherwise be scanned. Everyone
# else is scanned, INCLUDING returning CONTRIBUTORs (a merged PR in the past
# does not vouch for the contents of this one) and first-timers
# (FIRST_TIME_CONTRIBUTOR / NONE).
#
# This is deliberately stricter than fork-e2e/should-mirror.sh, which trusts
# CONTRIBUTOR: that gate only decides whether to spend a rate-limited test
# token, whereas this gate decides whether to inspect for attacks, so it errs
# toward scanning more.
#
# author_association is computed by GitHub from the actor's relationship to the
# repo at event time; it is not attacker-settable from PR contents.
#
# Maintainer escape hatch: an untrusted PR can be waived by the
# `skip-security-scan` label, but ONLY when the waiver is maintainer-effective
# -- the label is present AND the author is a maintainer, or a maintainer's
# latest decisive review is APPROVED. Same semantics as e2e-ui-required's
# `skip-e2e-ui-test` (and force-merge): the label alone is not enough, so a fork
# author cannot self-waive (applying labels needs triage access anyway, and the
# extra maintainer check is defence in depth). All state is read from the API
# (trusted), and this script always runs from `main`, so a PR cannot edit the
# decision. The waiver is only evaluated when MAINTAINERS is passed (the scan
# does; the per-workflow pollers do not -- they just mirror the scan's result).
#
# Env in:  EVENT_NAME          (github.event_name)

#                               optional -- when empty the skip label is ignored)
#          GH_TOKEN, REPO, PR  (for the waiver lookup; needed only with MAINTAINERS)
