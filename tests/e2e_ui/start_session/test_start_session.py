"""E2E: starting a new session from the home composer ("/").

The landing composer (``NewChatLandingScreen`` in
``ap-web/src/shell/NewChatDialog.tsx``) owns session creation end to end:
the textarea is the new session's first message and the footer chips —
host, working directory, git worktree — plus the agent picker and its
Advanced settings menu supply every create parameter. Hitting Send POSTs
``/v1/sessions`` and navigates to the new session; there is no modal.

These tests cover the three configuration affordances the user reaches
before sending:

1. **Permission mode** — Claude Code's ``--permission-mode`` choices, in
   the agent picker's Advanced settings menu. A non-default pick rides
   along as ``terminal_launch_args``.
2. **Working directory** — the file-browser popover behind the working-
   directory chip. Browsing into a folder sets the session's
   ``workspace``.
3. **Git worktree** — the branch chip's popover. Naming a branch attaches
   a ``git`` worktree spec to the create.

Why the heavy ``page.route`` stubbing (mirrors
``sessions/test_initial_prompt_session_switch.py``): the e2e harness's
runner is directly tunneled into the server and registers no *host*, and
the host filesystem endpoint has nothing to browse. The composer needs an
online host, an agent catalog, and (for the folder test) a directory
listing the headless harness can't produce, so ``/v1/hosts``,
``/v1/agents``, and ``/v1/hosts/{id}/filesystem`` are faked. The create
``POST /v1/sessions`` is intercepted too: rather than really launch a
session, the handler *captures the request body* — which is the thing
under test (that each selection reached the create call) — and returns a
real pre-seeded session id so the post-send navigation lands somewhere
real. ``/events`` is stubbed so the auto-sent first prompt never dispatches
a real LLM turn.

The async-in-a-fresh-thread shape is inherited from
``test_initial_prompt_session_switch`` for the same reason documented
there: once a pytest-playwright *sync* test has run in the session,
pytest-asyncio can't start a loop on the main thread, so each async body
runs in its own thread via :func:`asyncio.run`.
