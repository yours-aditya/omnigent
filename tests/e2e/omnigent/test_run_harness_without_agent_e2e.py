"""Live REPL e2e for ``omnigent run --harness`` without AGENT.

This test drives the user-facing launcher shape::

    omnigent run --harness <harness> -p <prompt>

under a real pseudo-TTY. It waits for the REPL banner, lets the
``-p`` startup hook submit a real user turn, and asserts the model
returns an exact marker. That covers the integration unit tests
cannot: Click optional-AGENT parsing, synthetic Omnigent YAML
materialization, Omnigent server boot, harness executor selection,
Databricks profile routing, REPL initial-message handling, and
model response rendering.

Run explicitly with Databricks credentials, for example::
