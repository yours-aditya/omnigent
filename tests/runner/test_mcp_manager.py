"""Unit tests for :class:`RunnerMcpManager`.

Cover invariants that survived the move from server-side ToolManager
to runner-side ownership (designs/RUNNER_MCP.md):

- partial failure: one MCP fails, others still surface their schemas
- spec-hash pool reuse: same spec across calls shares one connection
  per server (only one connect per server lifetime)
- invalid-name filtering: tools whose names violate the LLM-call
  constraint never reach the schema list
- tool-name collision: two MCPs in the same spec exposing the same
  name produce well-defined dispatch behavior

Plus new runner-side invariants the refactor introduced: LRU pool
eviction at capacity, prewarm idempotency, and prewarm cancellation
on shutdown.
