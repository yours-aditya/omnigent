"""
macOS Seatbelt (``sandbox-exec``) sandbox backend.

Spawn-time wrapper that prepends ``sandbox-exec -f <profile-file>`` to
the helper argv, building a Sandbox Profile Language (SBPL) policy
from the resolved :class:`omnigent.inner.sandbox.SandboxPolicy`.
Opt-in via ``os_env.sandbox.type: darwin_seatbelt`` in YAML; selected
as the macOS platform default when ``sandbox-exec`` is on ``PATH``.

The profile is written to a mode-0600 tempfile in a parent-owned
tmpdir (NOT inside the helper's scratch view) and the file path is
passed to ``sandbox-exec -f`` instead of the profile being inlined
via ``-p``. This hides the profile contents from ``ps aux``: with
``-p`` the full SBPL — up to 256 KiB of cwd structure, dotfile mask
paths, and egress socket path — is visible to any same-host user via
``ps``; with ``-f`` only the file path appears.

Privileged capabilities are intentionally NOT granted in the SBPL
profile (security hardening over what other reference profiles
typically emit):

- ``mach-priv-host-port`` — not needed for the helper subprocess and
  is the primary lever for kernel-task IPC bypasses.
- ``iokit-open`` — not needed; would expose camera, microphone, GPU
  drivers, and every other IOKit user-client.
- Broad ``(allow file-read* file-write* (subpath "/dev"))`` — narrowed
  to ``(allow file-read* (subpath "/dev"))`` for read and per-literal
  write allows on ``/dev/null``, ``/dev/tty``, ``/dev/dtracehelper``,
  so the helper can't write through arbitrary device nodes.

This is the **macOS parity** for :mod:`omnigent.inner.bwrap_sandbox`.
The two backends share:

- The same :class:`SandboxPolicy` semantics (read roots, write roots,
  write files, allow-network, dotfile allowlist, env passthrough,
  egress relay/socket).
- The same cwd dotfile/escaping-symlink walker
  (:func:`omnigent.inner._cwd_scan.scan_cwd_mask_entries`).
- The same egress filtering pipeline: parent-side
  :class:`omnigent.inner.egress.proxy.EgressProxy`, Unix socket
  bridge in the scratch tmpdir, in-helper TCP→Unix relay via
  :func:`omnigent.inner.egress.relay.start_relay`, and
  ``HTTP_PROXY`` / ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` env injection.
- The same observable behaviour: writes outside cwd blocked, scratch
  tmpdir writable, hidden dotfiles inaccessible, env stripping,
  default-deny egress.

Default view inside the sandbox:

- ``/usr``, ``/System``, ``/Library``, ``/bin``, ``/sbin``,
  ``/private/etc``, plus a handful of dyld/timezone caches under
  ``/private/var`` are readable.
- The cwd is readable; writable iff ``write_paths`` includes ``"."``.
- The per-helper scratch tmpdir (added by the spawn site via
  :func:`omnigent.inner.sandbox.with_additional_write_roots`) is
  read-write and surfaced via ``$TMPDIR``.
- ``$HOME`` is hidden by the ``(deny default)`` baseline rather than
  an explicit subpath deny. Anything under ``$HOME`` not covered by
  cwd / scratch / read_paths / write_paths / write_files /
  interpreter-visibility is inaccessible — ``~/.aws/credentials``,
  ``~/.ssh/id_rsa``, ``~/.gnupg``, etc. all return EPERM.
- Top-level dotfiles / dotdirs anywhere under cwd are denied unless
  their basename is in :data:`_DEFAULT_CWD_ALLOW_HIDDEN` or the
  spec's ``cwd_allow_hidden``. ``.venv`` is allowed by default.
- The default network policy depends on egress and ``allow_network``:

  - egress active → ``network*`` denied except loopback to the
    in-helper relay (``127.0.0.1:<port>``) and the parent's Unix
    socket bridge (``literal "<socket>"``).
  - egress inactive, ``allow_network=false`` → ``network*`` denied
    by the default-deny rule (no allow rules emitted).
  - egress inactive, ``allow_network=true`` → ``(allow network*)``
    emitted so the helper sees the host's full network stack.

Known deltas from ``linux_bwrap`` (documented intentionally — see
:doc:`/designs/SANDBOXED_TOOL_EXECUTION` for the full rationale):

- **No PID / UTS / IPC namespace isolation.** macOS has no
  ``unshare(2)``; ``sandbox-exec`` only restricts capabilities at
  the syscall-policy level, not via process namespaces. The helper
  can ``ps`` and see other processes on the host (subject to TCC).
- **No seccomp denylist.** The shared k8s-derived baseline syscall
  blocks (``mount``, ``setns``, ``ptrace``, …) do not apply. SBPL
  blocks dangerous *capabilities* (``deny default`` + selective
  allows) rather than individual syscalls.
- **Masking is access-deny, not invisibility.** A masked file like
  ``.env`` is still visible to ``stat``/``readdir`` but read/write
  syscalls return ``EPERM``. The bwrap path bind-mounts
  ``/dev/null`` so the file appears empty. Scripts that branch on
  existence vs readability behave slightly differently.
- **SBPL deny-wins.** ``sandbox-exec`` evaluates deny rules as
  strictly winning over allow rules for the same operation on the
  same path, regardless of rule order or specificity. The bwrap
  semantics are different (mount-overlay layers compose). The
  profile generator avoids broad ``deny`` rules (e.g., a
  ``deny ... (subpath HOME)`` would override every cwd / venv /
  read_path allow under HOME) and instead relies on the global
  ``(deny default)`` plus narrow per-path denies for the dotfile
  mask, where deny-wins is precisely what we want.
- **AF_UNIX path-length cap.** macOS limits ``sun_path`` to ~104
  bytes (vs 108 on Linux). The default scratch path under
  ``/var/folders/.../T/omnigent-osenv-XXXXXX/.egress.sock`` is
  typically ~80 bytes — under the cap — but a custom ``$TMPDIR``
  in a deeply nested path could exceed it. The egress proxy will
  fail loud at bind time when that happens.
- **Profile size cap.** ``sandbox-exec`` has an undocumented profile
  size limit (~64 KB in practice). The
  ``cwd_hidden_scan_max_entries`` cap (default 50000) already
  bounds the worst case, and we additionally fail loud at spawn
  time when the emitted profile exceeds :data:`_MAX_PROFILE_BYTES`.

# S5 (security): per-user HOME subpaths denied by default UNLESS the

# non-dotfile-shaped credential / personal-data stores (browser
# cookies, Slack tokens, Docker keychain, Mail, Messages, app
# preferences with stored credentials) and so escapes the dotfile
# masker entirely. A spec author who writes ``read_paths: ["~/"]``
# (or any ancestor of ``$HOME/Library``) usually means "give the
# agent the workspace stuff under HOME"; they almost never mean
# "let the agent read every Chrome cookie and Slack session
# token on this Mac". Default-deny matches that intent.
#
# Suppression rule: a candidate ``$HOME/<subpath>`` is removed from
# the deny set when ANY ``read_paths`` entry equals it or lives
# under it. That way ``read_paths: ["~/Library/Logs"]`` (legitimate
# debug-log workload) suppresses the deny; ``read_paths:
# ["~/Library"]`` opts in for the whole tree (auditable in the
# spec); ``read_paths: ["~/"]`` does NOT suppress (the operator
# named the ancestor, not the candidate, so the default-deny
# stands).
#
# CAVEAT (documented for spec authors): SBPL deny-wins-over-allow
# is all-or-nothing at the subpath level. So when an operator
# writes BOTH ``~/Library/Logs`` AND ``~/`` in ``read_paths``, the
# narrow Logs grant suppresses the ``~/Library`` deny and the
# broad ``~/`` grant then exposes the rest of Library. To get
# "Logs only" semantics, the operator must drop the broad ``~/``
# grant and list only the specific subtrees they need (the
# dotfile masker keeps ``~/.aws`` etc. safe under any read grant).
#
# Linux gets an empty tuple — Linux puts everything credential-
# shaped under dotfiles (``~/.aws``, ``~/.config/gcloud``,

        Build the ``sandbox-exec`` argv that wraps *argv* under an
        SBPL profile loaded from a mode-0600 tempfile.

        Returns ``[<abs-sandbox-exec>, "-f", <profile-path>, *argv]``.
        The profile is generated by :func:`_build_profile` and
        written by :func:`_write_profile_to_tempfile`; see those
        functions for the rule layout and on-disk lifecycle.

        M5/M6 (security):

        - The profile is passed via ``-f <file>`` instead of
          ``-p <inline>`` so the contents (cwd structure, dotfile
          mask paths, egress socket path — up to 256 KiB) don't
          appear in ``ps aux`` output for any same-host user. With
          ``-p`` the full SBPL is in argv, visible to every user;
          with ``-f`` only the file path appears. The file itself
          is mode 0600 in a parent-owned tmpdir not reachable from
          the helper's sandbox view.
        - ``sandbox-exec`` is resolved to its absolute path at
          module import time (:data:`_SANDBOX_EXEC_PATH`) so the
          spawn call never goes through ``$PATH`` lookup at
          ``subprocess.Popen`` time, closing a small TOCTOU window
          where ``$PATH`` could change between resolver-time
          ``shutil.which`` and Popen-time resolution.

        Unlike bwrap, ``sandbox-exec`` has no ``--chdir`` equivalent
        — the *chdir* parameter is intentionally ignored here.
        The helper subprocess does its own ``os.chdir`` based on the
        ``cwd`` field in its JSON config (set by the parent's
        ``_HelperProcessClient`` to either the workspace or the
        scratch tmpdir when ``start_in_scratch`` is true). End state
        is identical to the bwrap path; only the moment of the
        chdir differs.

        :param argv: The unwrapped helper command, typically
            ``[sys.executable, "-m", "omnigent.inner.os_env",
            "helper", "<encoded>"]``. ``argv[0]`` is inspected to
            ensure the interpreter path is reachable inside the
            sandbox — when it lives outside the default RO subtrees
            and outside cwd (a typical pyenv / venv layout under
            ``$HOME``), extra ``allow file-read*`` rules are added so
            the kernel can open the binary after the HOME deny.
        :param policy: The :class:`SandboxPolicy` produced by
            :meth:`resolve`, possibly augmented by
            :func:`omnigent.inner.sandbox.with_additional_write_roots`
            (the parent adds the per-helper scratch tmpdir there
            before calling this).
        :param cwd: Workspace directory exposed to the helper. Always
            given file-read access regardless of *chdir* so the agent
            can reach project files via absolute paths even when the
            helper starts elsewhere.
        :param chdir: Ignored. Present for interface parity with
            :class:`SandboxBackend.wrap_launcher_argv`; the helper
            chdirs itself from its JSON config.
        :returns: A complete ``sandbox-exec`` argv ready for
            ``subprocess.Popen`` — never an empty list.
        :raises OSError: When the cwd-scan cap is hit and overflow is
            ``"error"``, when the emitted profile exceeds

    Build the SBPL profile text for *policy*.

    SBPL evaluation note: deny rules in ``sandbox-exec`` win over
    allow rules regardless of order or specificity once both match
    the same operation on the same path. That asymmetry is what
    drives this layout — we additively grant access with ``allow``
    rules, and rely on the global ``(deny default)`` to handle
    everything not explicitly allowed (including ``$HOME``). Per-path
    deny rules are reserved for the dotfile mask, where deny-wins
    is exactly what we want.

    The rule sections, in emission order:

    1. ``(version 1)`` + ``(deny default (with no-log))`` baseline.
    2. Process / mach / sysctl / iokit allows needed by libSystem.
    3. Read-only system roots (``/usr``, ``/System``, …).
    4. cwd read access + conditional cwd write access. ``$HOME`` is
       intentionally NOT explicitly denied — the default-deny
       handles it, and a blanket HOME deny would silently override
       the cwd / venv / read_paths allows when those paths live
       under HOME (the common case).
    5. Helper interpreter visibility (argv[0] parents when outside
       cwd and the default RO subtrees).
    6. Scratch tmpdir RW.
    7. Extra read roots, write roots, write files.
    8. Dotfile / escaping-symlink mask — per-path denies that win
       over the cwd allow exactly because deny beats allow in SBPL.
    9. Network rules.

    :param policy: The resolved :class:`SandboxPolicy`. Provides cwd
        writability, scratch tmpdir, read/write roots, dotfile
        allowlist, network knobs, and egress relay configuration.
    :param cwd: Workspace directory the helper was launched from,
        already resolved (no symlinks). Bound read-only at minimum.
    :param extra_read_paths: Additional directories that must be
        readable for ``argv[0]`` (the helper interpreter) to be
        exec'd inside the sandbox — typically a venv ``bin/`` and
        its parent when ``argv[0]`` lives under ``$HOME`` (which
        the explicit HOME deny would otherwise block). Emitted as
        ``(allow file-read* (subpath ...))`` AFTER the HOME deny so
        last-match-wins re-allows the interpreter.
    :returns: The SBPL profile text, ready to pass to
        ``sandbox-exec -p``. Always a non-empty string starting with
        ``(version 1)``.

) -> list[Path]:
    """
    Return extra read-subpath directories needed so ``argv[0]`` (the
    helper interpreter) is reachable inside the Seatbelt sandbox.

    Parallel to
    :func:`omnigent.inner.bwrap_sandbox._ensure_executable_visible`,
    but emits :class:`Path` directories to be added as
    ``(allow file-read* (subpath ...))`` rules rather than
    ``--ro-bind-try`` mounts. The kernel's ``execve`` reads the
    literal path first, then dereferences symlinks to the target
    binary — both paths plus all their dyld-loaded dylibs must be
    readable inside the sandbox.

    Why subpath, not literal-chain: empirically, when the kernel
    resolves a symlink target, it requires the parent chain of the
    target to be reachable via subpath rules. A chain of
    ``(literal "/opt") (literal "/opt/homebrew") ... (literal
    "...python3.12")`` does NOT permit exec of the resolved binary.
    Only ``(subpath ...)`` on a parent works. The smallest such
    parent that always works is the topmost non-default ancestor
    (the first child of ``/``).

    H1/H2/H3 (security): the topmost-ancestor scheme is intentionally
    DENIED for first-children-of-``/`` listed in
    :data:`_UNSAFE_WIDEN_ANCESTORS` (``/Users``, ``/private``,
    ``/var``, ``/etc``, ``/tmp``, ``/Volumes``, ``/Network``,
    ``/Applications``). Widening to any of those would silently grant
    read access to other users' home directories, credentials, logs,
    audit data, or system runtime state. When the helper interpreter
    lives under one of those (e.g. ``/Users/me/.pyenv/.../python``),
    this function attempts a tighter fallback via
    :func:`_interpreter_install_root` — granting only the
    self-contained CPython install directory (``<root>/bin/python*``
    + ``<root>/lib/python*``) rather than the broad ancestor. If the
    layout doesn't match the CPython install shape it raises
    :class:`OSError` with an actionable remediation list rather than
    silently widening.

    Typical cases:

    - ``/usr/bin/python3`` (literal == resolved): covered by the
      default ``/usr`` subpath; nothing extra emitted.
    - ``/opt/homebrew/.../python3.12``: covered by the default
      ``/opt`` subpath; nothing extra emitted.
    - ``./.venv/bin/python`` under cwd, symlinking to a Homebrew
      python: literal covered by cwd subpath; resolved covered by
      ``/opt`` default; nothing extra emitted.
    - ``./.venv/bin/python`` under cwd, symlinking to an uv-managed
      python under ``~/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-X.Y.Z-.../``:
      literal covered by cwd subpath; resolved would otherwise hit
      the ``/Users`` unsafe-widen guard, but
      :func:`_interpreter_install_root` detects the CPython install
      shape and emits a narrow
      ``(subpath ~/.local/share/uv/python/cpython-X.Y.Z-...)``
      instead. A WARNING is logged so the auto-widen is auditable.
    - ``/Users/me/.pyenv/versions/3.12/bin/python`` (pyenv): same
      narrow-fallback path — granted as
      ``(subpath /Users/me/.pyenv/versions/3.12)``.
    - ``/Users/me/random-script-that-isnt-python`` (no ``bin/`` +
      ``lib/python*`` shape): falls through to :class:`OSError`.
      Operator must switch to a covered interpreter or add a
      narrow ``read_paths`` entry covering only the interpreter
      tree.

    .. note::

       **Test-harness gotcha.** Earlier revisions of this function
       silently emitted ``[Path("/Users")]`` when the test runner's
       ``sys.executable`` lived outside ``tmp_path`` (a typical
       pytest layout where the runner's venv is under ``$HOME`` and
       cwd is under ``/private/var/folders``). That broad
       ``(subpath /Users)`` rule INCIDENTALLY satisfied the
       ``realpath()`` ancestor walk for *any* path under ``/Users``,
       masking missing-ancestor-traversal bugs from every test for
       the entire feature branch. The current implementation
       refuses to widen to ``/Users`` (and the other entries in
       :data:`_UNSAFE_WIDEN_ANCESTORS`) and only emits a narrow
       per-install-root subpath when the binary matches the
       canonical CPython install shape (see
       :func:`_interpreter_install_root`). Tests that need a
       homebrew-style venv install can still place the interpreter
       under cwd or under one of the default safe roots (``/opt``,
       ``/usr``); tests asserting the narrow-fallback path live
       beside the H1/H2/H3 regression suite in
       ``tests/inner/test_seatbelt_sandbox.py``.

    :param argv: Helper argv. The function inspects ``argv[0]``.
    :param cwd: Effective working directory; used to skip the allow
        when the interpreter already lives under cwd.
    :returns: Extra directory paths (possibly empty) to add as
        ``allow file-read* subpath`` rules. Never includes a path
        already covered by :data:`_DEFAULT_READ_SUBPATHS` or by

        returned is the tighter Python install root detected by
        :func:`_interpreter_install_root` (logged at WARNING for
        audit), or the function raises :class:`OSError` when no
        tighter root applies.
    :raises OSError: When the helper interpreter would require
        widening the sandbox to an entry in
        :data:`_UNSAFE_WIDEN_ANCESTORS` AND no narrower Python

    Detect a self-contained CPython install root anchored at *exe*.

    Returns the directory two levels above *exe* — i.e. *exe*'s
    grand-parent — when it has the shape of a standalone CPython
    install:

    - ``exe.parent`` is named ``bin`` (the canonical ``bin/python*``
      layout used by every official CPython distribution: cpython.org
      installer, ``python-build-standalone`` artefacts shipped by uv
      and rye, pyenv ``versions/<ver>``, asdf ``installs/python/<ver>``,
      Homebrew Cellar python kegs, conda envs, system ``/usr``).
    - ``<root>/lib`` exists and is a real directory.
    - ``<root>/lib`` contains EITHER a directory whose name starts
      with ``python`` (the stdlib payload, e.g. ``lib/python3.12``)
      OR a file whose name starts with ``libpython`` and carries a
      shared-library extension (``.dylib`` on macOS, ``.so`` on
      Linux when this code runs against bwrap tests). Both markers
      are unique to CPython — an arbitrary HOME directory that
      happens to have ``bin/`` and ``lib/`` siblings (``~/.local/``
      itself, ``~/`` for users who symlink ``~/bin``, …) will fail
      the marker check and the caller falls through to OSError.

    The shape is intentionally tight so the auto-widen path can only
    grant access to actual Python toolchain directories, never to
    arbitrary HOME subtrees. The grant is on the install root
    (``<root>``) so the kernel can both ``exec`` ``bin/python*`` and
    ``dlopen`` everything under ``lib/`` (the runtime + stdlib
    extension modules) under the SBPL subpath rule.

    The directory lives at
    ``<system tmpdir>/omnigent-seatbelt-profiles-XXXX`` with mode
    0700. Profile files are written here with mode 0600 — both
    layers are needed because some macOS configurations (e.g. an
    NFS-backed tmpdir, certain enterprise MDM profiles) override
    the umask and the per-file mode is the only reliable guard.

    The directory is intentionally OUTSIDE the helper's scratch
    tmpdir: the helper's sandbox profile grants it read/write
    access to its own scratch dir, so writing profiles there would
    let the agent ``cat`` them at runtime and learn the cwd-mask
    structure / egress socket path. A separate parent-only tmpdir
    keeps the profile contents invisible to the helper.

    The file is created with ``tempfile.mkstemp`` (which opens with
    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` so a same-user attacker can't race-replace
    the path between create and write) and immediately ``chmod``ed
    to 0600. The path is appended to :data:`_PROFILE_CLEANUP_PATHS`
    so :func:`_cleanup_profile_files` (registered via
    :func:`atexit.register`) unlinks it at interpreter shutdown.

    The file lives for the lifetime of the helper subprocess:
    ``sandbox-exec`` reads the profile during its own startup
    (synchronous before ``execve`` of the target), but we can't
    safely unlink it earlier because ``subprocess.Popen`` returns
    after fork but before the child has finished reading the
    profile, so an early unlink would race against the read. The
