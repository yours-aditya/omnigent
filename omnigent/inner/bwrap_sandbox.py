"""
Linux Bubblewrap sandbox backend.

Builds a hermetic mount-namespace view via the ``bwrap`` launcher and
layers a hardened seccomp profile on top once the helper has exec'd
inside the namespace. Selected as the Linux platform default when
the ``bwrap`` binary is on ``PATH`` (see
:func:`omnigent.inner.sandbox._default_sandbox_for_platform`); spec
authors can also pin it explicitly via ``os_env.sandbox.type:
linux_bwrap`` in YAML.

Default view inside the sandbox:

- ``/usr``, ``/lib*``, ``/bin``, ``/sbin`` mounted read-only.
- A small allow-list of ``/etc`` files needed for libc / DNS / TLS
  (``/etc/resolv.conf``, ``/etc/hosts``, ``/etc/nsswitch.conf``,
  ``/etc/passwd``, ``/etc/group``, ``/etc/localtime``,
  ``/etc/ld.so.cache``, ``/etc/ld.so.conf``,
  ``/etc/ld.so.conf.d``, ``/etc/ssl``, ``/etc/ca-certificates``,
  ``/etc/pki``) bound read-only via ``--ro-bind-try``.
- Fresh ``/proc``, ``/dev``, and ``/tmp``.
- Cwd bind-mounted read-only by default; explicit
  ``write_paths: ["."]`` flips it to read-write. Top-level
  dotfiles / dotdirs in cwd are tmpfs-masked unless their name is
  in :data:`_DEFAULT_CWD_ALLOW_HIDDEN` (``.venv`` by default) or
  :attr:`OSEnvSandboxSpec.cwd_allow_hidden`.
- The per-helper scratch tmpdir created by
  :func:`omnigent.inner.sandbox.create_private_tmpdir` is
  bind-mounted read-write and surfaced via ``$TMPDIR``.
- ``$HOME`` is **never** mounted. ``/root``, ``/var``, and host
  dotfiles never leak.

Hardened seccomp profile applied by :meth:`BwrapSandboxBackend.activate`
inside the helper, on top of ``PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS``:

1. :data:`omnigent.inner._seccomp.BASELINE_DENYLIST_SYSCALLS` — the
   shared k8s/containerd-derived denylist (mount/pivot_root family,
   kernel-module loaders, BPF, kernel keyring, time-setters,
   namespace primitives, plus our own ``ptrace``-family hardening).
2. Argument-filtered ``clone(flags, ...)``: any ``CLONE_NEW*`` bit
   set in arg 0 returns ``EPERM``. ``fork()`` /
   ``pthread_create()`` keep working (they don't set ``CLONE_NEW*``).
3. ``clone3`` denied with ``ENOSYS`` (not ``EPERM``) — the
   ``struct clone_args`` flags live in user memory that seccomp
   can't dereference, so we can't arg-filter ``clone3``. We return
   ``ENOSYS`` because glibc's ``clone_internal`` only falls back to
   the legacy ``clone`` syscall on ``ENOSYS``; returning ``EPERM``
   here makes ``pthread_create`` fail outright on Ubuntu 22.04 +
   glibc 2.34+ (which use ``clone3`` for thread creation), which
   would break the in-helper egress relay thread. Same trade-off
   Flatpak / Snap / Firejail accept.
4. Argument-filtered ``socket(domain, ...)``: an allowlist of
   ``AF_UNIX`` (1), ``AF_INET`` (2), ``AF_INET6`` (10). Every other
   socket family is denied with ``EPERM``. This is future-proof —
   new kernel socket families are blocked by default without code
   changes.

    Three rule families, all returning ``EPERM`` against the default
    ``SCMP_ACT_ALLOW``:

    1. ``clone(flags, ...)`` denied when any ``CLONE_NEW*`` bit is set
       (one rule per bit, matched with ``SCMP_CMP_MASKED_EQ``).
       ``fork()`` and ``pthread_create()`` keep working — they don't
       set ``CLONE_NEW*``.
    2. ``clone3`` denied with ``ENOSYS``. ``struct clone_args`` lives
       in user memory that seccomp can't dereference, so we can't
       arg-filter it. We return ``ENOSYS`` (not ``EPERM``) because
       glibc's ``clone_internal`` only falls back to legacy ``clone``
       on ``ENOSYS`` — returning ``EPERM`` propagates up and breaks
       ``pthread_create`` on glibc 2.34+ (Ubuntu 22.04+), which uses
       ``clone3`` for thread creation. The fallback to legacy
       ``clone`` is still caught by rule 1 if the spawn carries a
       ``CLONE_NEW*`` bit, so namespace-creation is still blocked.
    3. ``socket(domain, ...)`` denied for all families NOT in
       :data:`_ALLOWED_SOCKET_FAMILIES`. Uses range-based deny rules:
       deny ``AF_UNSPEC`` (0), deny families 3–9 (gap between
       ``AF_INET`` and ``AF_INET6``), and deny ``>= 11`` via
       ``SCMP_CMP_GE`` — catching all current and future families
       above ``AF_INET6`` without code changes.

    These rules are bwrap-specific because (a) bwrap already set up a
    fresh PID/UTS/IPC namespace so blocking nested namespace creation
    is a true defense-in-depth layer rather than a workload break,
    and (b) the bwrap helper has no legitimate use for raw netlink
    or packet sockets. The shared baseline does not include them so
    other backends can adopt the baseline without inheriting this
    extra restriction.

    chain at ``argv[0]`` hop-by-hop. At each hop, the literal path's

    kernel traverses the literal ``cpython-3.12`` name, so we mount the
    real ``cpython-3.12.13`` contents there.

      runs in ``/tmp/scratch`` (uv-managed Python with intermediate
      ``cpython-3.12`` symlink): binds the venv bin/lib roots at the

      name, with the real ``cpython-3.12.13`` mounted there.

    literal-and-resolved parent (and grandparent) of ``argv[0]`` so
    the dotfile walker doesn't mask the helper interpreter symlink.

    Without the interpreter widening, a ``read_paths`` grant covering
    a workspace whose venv resolves into a non-default install root
    (e.g. ``/opt/hostedtoolcache/Python/.../bin/python3.12`` on
    GitHub-hosted Linux runners, where ``/opt`` is NOT in
    :data:`_DEFAULT_RO_DIRS`) would have the S5 read_paths scan flag
    ``.venv/bin/python`` as an escaping symlink and emit a
    ``--bind /dev/null`` mask over it — making the helper unspawnable
    with the bwrap error
    ``Can't create file at .venv/bin/python: No such file or directory``.
    Including the resolved interpreter parents keeps the scanner
    consistent with what :func:`_ensure_executable_visible` will
    already bind in for the helper.

    Backends that expose a different default mount set (e.g.
    ``darwin_seatbelt``) build their own list with the same shape.

    """
    Build the bwrap mount args needed to mask dotfile / escaping
    entries the helper must not see, across BOTH cwd and every
    spec-supplied ``read_paths`` root.

    Thin emitter over :func:`omnigent.inner._cwd_scan.scan_cwd_mask_entries`:
    the shared walker decides *which* paths to mask (dotfiles by
    basename + escaping symlinks); this function maps each
    :class:`MaskedEntry` to the bwrap mount triple that hides it.

    Mask shape depends on entry kind because bwrap mount targets are
    type-checked at the kernel level:

    - **Directories** are masked with ``--tmpfs <path>`` — the agent
      sees an empty in-memory directory.
    - **Files / symlinks / sockets** are masked with
      ``--bind-try /dev/null <path>`` — the agent sees what looks like
      an empty file (reads return EOF, writes are discarded).
      ``/dev/null`` is always present inside the sandbox via the
      ``--dev /dev`` mount. ``--bind-try`` (rather than ``--bind``)
      tolerates TOCTOU races: transient files (e.g. ``.coverage.*``)
      may vanish between the scan and the ``bwrap`` exec; the
      ``-try`` variant silently skips the mount instead of aborting.

    S5 (security): the walk covers each ``read_paths`` root in
    addition to ``cwd`` so a broad grant like ``read_paths: ["~/"]``
    does NOT leave ``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh``, ``~/.config/gcloud`` etc.
    readable just because the dotfile masker used to be cwd-only.
    Roots that live under ``cwd`` are skipped — the cwd pass already
    covered them. Per-path dedup runs across both passes.

    See :mod:`omnigent.inner._cwd_scan` for the masking-decision
    semantics, walk-cap behaviour, and the
    ``cwd_hidden_scan_max_entries`` / ``cwd_hidden_scan_overflow``
    tuning knobs. Each root is walked under the same cap; a
    ``read_paths: ["~/"]`` grant will almost always trip it and the
    resulting :class:`OSError` points at the same tunables (the
    right answer in almost every case is to narrow the grant).

    :param cwd: Effective working directory of the helper, already
        resolved (no symlinks).
    :param allow_hidden: Dotfile / dotdir basenames that pass through
        unmasked at any depth, e.g. ``[".venv"]``.
    :param policy: Sandbox policy. Provides the read/write roots that
        contribute to the symlink-escape safe set and the
        ``cwd_hidden_scan_max_entries`` / ``cwd_hidden_scan_overflow``
        knobs.
    :returns: Flat list of bwrap argv tokens (alternating
        ``--tmpfs <path>`` and ``--bind-try /dev/null <path>`` triples).
        Empty when nothing worth masking was found.
    :raises OSError: When the entry cap is reached and the policy's
        overflow mode is ``"error"``.
