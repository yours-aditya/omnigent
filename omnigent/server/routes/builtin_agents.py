"""Read-only route for discovering built-in agents (``GET /v1/agents``).

Built-in agents are the long-lived, shared agents the server provides
out of the box — the seeded ``claude-native-ui`` agent plus anything
registered at startup with ``omnigent server --agent``. They are the
``session_id IS NULL`` rows in ``agent_store``; ``agent_store.list()``
already filters to exactly these. Session-scoped agents (created via
multipart ``POST /v1/sessions``) belong to one conversation and are read
through ``GET /v1/sessions/{id}/agent`` — never here.

The Web UI's new-session picker calls this to discover bindable
built-ins, then creates a session with
``POST /v1/sessions {agent_id, host_id, workspace}``. See
``designs/BUILTIN_AGENTS.md``.

This is the read-only successor to the removed ``GET /api/agents`` list:
there is intentionally no create/update/delete — agent writes happen
through session creation.
