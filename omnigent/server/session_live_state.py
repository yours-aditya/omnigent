"""Best-effort persistence of per-session live state to the conversations table.

The sidebar's live fields — ``runner_online``, turn ``status``, and the
pending-approval count — were historically served from in-memory caches
that exist only on the server replica holding a session's runner tunnel
(the tunnel registry, the SSE-relay status cache, and the
pending-elicitations index). Under host_id replica sharding a session
list / ``WS /v1/sessions/updates`` request can land on any replica, so
those fields must also live somewhere every replica can read: the
``conversations`` row (regional DB).

This module is the single write chokepoint. The in-memory caches remain
the synchronous source on the tunnel-holding replica; every cache write
also enqueues a row write here. Writes are:

- **best-effort** — a failed write logs and is dropped; live state is
  display state, and the next transition rewrites it. A dropped write
  also evicts its dedupe entry, so the next *identical* publish is not
  swallowed and gets a fresh attempt (see :func:`_submit`).
- **ordered** — a single-worker executor serializes writes, so a
  ``running`` → ``idle`` pair can never apply out of order.
- **off the event loop** — the store is synchronous SQLAlchemy; callers
  (the SSE relay, the tunnel handlers, the pub-sub hot path) only pay a
  dict check and a queue put. The write runs in a copy of the caller's
  ``contextvars`` (see :func:`_submit`) so the per-request
  ``workspace_scope`` — which every store query filters on — reaches the
  worker thread; a bare executor would run at the default workspace and
  every ``WHERE workspace_id == …`` would match no rows on a multi-tenant
  replica.
- **deduplicated** — re-publishing an unchanged status / count is a
  no-op, so chatty relays don't turn into row churn.

No-op until :func:`configure` wires a store (the server app does this at
startup); the runner process and unit tests that never configure it are
unaffected.
