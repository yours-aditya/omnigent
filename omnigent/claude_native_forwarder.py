    Tail Claude's JSONL transcript and mirror semantic items into AP.

    This loop is intentionally independent of Claude Channels. It
    runs while the native terminal is attached, watches the transcript
    path reported by Claude hooks, and posts new user text,
    assistant text, tool calls, and tool results as external AP
    conversation items.

    :param base_url: Omnigent server base URL.
    :param headers: Static HTTP headers for Omnigent requests. Authorization
        is normally supplied via ``auth`` instead so OAuth tokens are
        refreshed per request; any ``Authorization`` value here is
        overridden by ``auth`` when both are set.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session/conversation id.
    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory.
    :param agent_name: Agent/model name to stamp on mirrored output.
    :param start_at_end: When ``True`` and no prior forward cursor
        exists, start from the current transcript end. This is used
        for reattach so old transcript lines are not duplicated.
    :param poll_interval_s: Seconds between transcript polls.
    :param auth: Optional httpx Auth that mints a fresh bearer token
        per request, e.g. ``_server_auth(profile)`` for a Databricks
        Apps deployment. ``None`` for local servers that don't need
        auth. Required for long-lived remote sessions — Databricks
        OAuth tokens expire after ~1 hour and a static header captured
        at startup would stop authenticating mid-session.
    :returns: Never normally returns; cancel the task to stop it.

    POST the parent session's cost as TWO values: display and policy.

    The parent session's cost-budget policy gates EVERY tool call in the
    Claude process — including a Task sub-agent's, whose ``PreToolUse``
    hook the runner evaluates against this parent session (the bridge has
    one active session id; there is no per-sub-agent policy routing). But
    Claude Code's statusLine ``total_cost_usd`` (``S``) is **frozen for
    the entire duration of a sub-agent run** — the statusLine isn't even
    invoked while a sub-agent runs; ``S`` jumps to the sub-agent-inclusive
    total only when the sub-agent returns (verified live). So a value
    based on ``S`` alone can't gate a runaway sub-agent mid-turn.

    Display and enforcement therefore need different numbers, posted as
    two separate fields the server persists independently:

    - ``cumulative_cost_usd`` = ``S`` verbatim — the DISPLAY cost. The
      parent badge then matches ``/cost`` in the Claude TUI exactly (``S``
      is Claude's own billing and already includes sub-agent spend once
      settled). It is frozen during a sub-agent run; that's acceptable
      for display.
    - ``policy_cost_usd`` = ``max(S, C)`` — the POLICY/budget cost. ``C``
      is the forwarder's real-time estimate (parent transcript own
      messages + each tracked sub-agent's transcript, each priced once
      per ``requestId``). ``C`` advances while ``S`` is frozen, so the
      gate sees in-flight sub-agent spend and can block mid-turn. With no
      sub-agent there is no lag, so it equals ``S``.

    The brief intra-turn divergence (badge shows frozen ``S`` while the
    gate uses the higher live ``C``) is intentional and reconciles at the
    turn boundary when ``S`` jumps; ``max`` keeps both monotonic.

    Best-effort, like the other forwarder posts: a failed POST is retried
    on the next poll (the ``dedupe`` baselines advance only on success).

    :param client: Omnigent HTTP client.

    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory (holds the

    :param parent_transcript_path: Parent transcript JSONL path — used for
        the ``C`` estimate and to locate the ``subagents/`` directory.
    :param subagent_state: Current sub-agent cursor map; its tracked
        sub-agents' transcripts contribute to ``C``.

    view permanently desynced from the running terminal. This
    supervisor restarts the forwarder with bounded exponential
    backoff so a transient crash recovers without operator action.

    Cancellation is honored: :class:`asyncio.CancelledError` exits
    the loop cleanly so the parent's teardown sequence (terminal
    stop, bridge cleanup) runs as before. Other
    :class:`BaseException` subclasses (``KeyboardInterrupt``,
    ``SystemExit``, ``GeneratorExit``) also propagate — only
    :class:`Exception` subclasses trigger a restart, so process-
    shutdown signals are not swallowed.

    The on-disk cursor in ``bridge_dir`` is the durable source of
    truth for progress, so restarts resume exactly where the prior
    run left off — ``start_at_end`` is only consulted on a cold
    bridge with no persisted cursor.

        ``"http://localhost:6767"``.
    :param headers: Static HTTP headers for Omnigent requests. Authorization
        is normally supplied via ``auth`` instead so OAuth tokens are
        refreshed per request.
    :param session_id: Omnigent session/conversation id, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param bridge_dir: Native Claude bridge directory.

        exists, start from the current transcript end.
    :param poll_interval_s: Seconds between transcript polls inside
        the forwarder loop. Forwarded verbatim.

        per request, e.g. ``_server_auth(profile)``. Forwarded verbatim

       viewing the old conversation auto-redirects to the new one.
