    Auto-create a Codex terminal for a codex-native session.

    Called when the runner receives a codex-native session via
    ``POST /v1/sessions`` or an explicit terminal ensure request and no
    terminal exists yet. Mirrors :func:`_auto_create_claude_terminal`: it
    boots a Codex app-server, registers the Codex TUI as a streamable
    terminal resource attached to that app-server, then runs the transcript
    forwarder so the chat and terminal share one thread.

    Fresh sessions launch without a thread id so the TUI owns thread
    creation; resume sessions launch with the persisted Codex thread id.
    The runner does not pre-create a thread, because ``codex resume`` of a
    thread with no rollout yet exits the TUI (leaving a dead pane).

    :param session_id: Session/conversation identifier, e.g.
        ``"conv_abc123"``.
    :param resource_registry: Session resource registry used to launch
        the Codex terminal resource.
    :param publish_event: The runner's per-session SSE emitter, used to
        surface the new terminal on the live stream (the Omnigent relay
        republishes it to the web UI) so the Terminal toggle enables
        without a refresh.
    :param bundle_dir: Materialized agent-bundle root when the session's
        agent ships a ``skills/`` directory, resolved by the caller
        (which has the runner's spec resolver). Its skills are linked
        into the per-bridge ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/`` before the
        app-server boots so the native Codex discovers them — matching
        the wrapped ``codex`` executor. ``None`` exposes no bundle skills.
    :param skills_filter: The agent spec's ``skills_filter`` (``"all"``
        / ``"none"`` / list of skill names), honoured when populating
        ``$CODEX_HOME/skills/``. Defaults to ``"all"``.
    :param agent_spec: Optional resolved agent spec for the session.
        When provided, its executor model is used as the Codex app-server
        default, e.g. ``"gpt-5.4-mini"``.
    :param server_client: Runner's Omnigent server HTTP client. Used to read
        persisted launch args and the native thread id.

    Auto-create an Omnigent REPL terminal for a runner-hosted SDK session.

    Called when the runner receives a non-native (SDK-harness) top-level
    session via ``POST /v1/sessions`` and no REPL terminal exists yet. The
    terminal hosts the framework's own TUI (``omnigent attach
    <session_id> --server <url>``) in a tmux pane, exposed through the
    standard terminal-attach WebSocket so the web UI embeds it exactly
    like the claude-/codex-native terminals — with the Omnigent REPL as
    the TUI.

    The REPL is a pure co-drive client: it joins the live session over
    HTTP+SSE and dispatches turns to this runner, so the web chat view and
    the embedded terminal stay in sync. The tmux command is deferred until
    the first client attaches (``tmux_start_on_attach``): a session whose
    terminal is never opened pays only for an idle tmux pane, and by first
    attach the session is fully live (``omnigent attach`` fails loud on a
    non-live session) with the REPL sized to the real attached terminal.

    Auth parity with the native terminals: the spawned ``omnigent
    attach`` resolves credentials for ``--server`` the same way a
    user-launched CLI does (``OMNIGENT_REMOTE_AUTH_TOKEN`` env → stored
    OIDC token from ``omnigent login`` → ``~/.databrickscfg``), which
    holds because the runner lives on the user's machine.

        Stop a claude-native session by injecting Escape into tmux.

        Claude-native sessions have no in-flight harness turn for the
        scaffold's ``InterruptEvent`` path to cancel — the harness's
        ``run_turn`` returns as soon as the user prompt is pasted
        into the tmux pane, and the actual long-running work (Claude
        generating a response) happens inside the ``claude`` binary
        in the pane. The only way to stop it is sending a key to the
        terminal.

        Sending the Escape is the whole job — no synthetic
        ``[System: interrupted]`` transcript marker is persisted. That
        marker exists for in-process LLM harnesses, where the runner's
        ``_session_histories`` *is* the model's next-turn context, so a
        cut-off turn must be repaired (dangling ``function_call`` items
        get synthetic outputs) and annotated. None of that applies to
        Claude-native: Claude owns its own session, the runner only types
        the latest user message into the pane, and Claude records the
        interrupt in its own transcript (mirrored by the forwarder). The
        web UI's interrupt decoration comes from the harness-agnostic
        ``session.interrupted`` event, not this marker. Persisting it here
        only forged a ``role:"user"`` bubble the user never sent into the
        AP-side mirror, diverging it from Claude's real transcript.

        Status is intentionally NOT synthesized here. The terminal's PTY
        activity watcher is the single source of truth: it emits
        ``session.status: idle`` once the pane quiesces after the Escape,
        and keeps the session ``running`` if the interrupt didn't actually
        stop Claude. Emitting ``idle`` here too (as this used to, back when
        the hook-based status couldn't observe idle-on-Escape) would
        bypass — and desync — the watcher's running/idle dedupe, and could
        strand the UI on ``idle`` while Claude kept working.

        Stop a codex-native turn via Codex app-server ``turn/interrupt``.

        Codex's own TUI maps its interrupt key to an app-server request
        carrying the active ``threadId`` and ``turnId``. The web/runner path
        should use that protocol directly instead of guessing at terminal
        keybindings: the Codex app-server validates that the requested turn is
        active and replies after the turn aborts.

        No interrupted marker is synthesized here. Codex records the interrupt
        only as a turn-status edge in its own transcript — not as a message — so
        injecting a ``[System: interrupted]`` bubble into the Omnigent mirror would
        diverge the web UI from Codex's actual session (and never survive a
        ``--resume``). Interruption surfaces via the harness-agnostic
        ``session.interrupted`` event; a durable, faithful indicator is a
        follow-up (persist turn status, render from that — no fabricated
        message). claude-native is unaffected: its badge mirrors Claude Code's
        *own* ``[Request interrupted by user]`` record, which is real.

        ``_active_turns`` is left stale (every later message then buffers and
        the session hangs). Detected by the entry still pointing at this task

        dispatches ``list_comments`` / ``update_comment``, then fires a
        ``notifications/tools/list_changed`` so a Claude Code instance that has
        already fetched its tool list re-fetches it.

        Idempotent and session-scoped: the relay is started once and lives
        until the session is deleted (see the cleanup in ``delete_session``).
        It is started from two places, whichever runs first:

        - ``create_session_terminal`` (the ``bridge_inject_dir`` branch), which
          fires as the Claude terminal launches — after the client has reset
          the bridge dir and before Claude Code's MCP client performs its
          initial ``tools/list``. This is the normal ``omnigent claude``
          path: the comment tools land on that first list with no notification
          race, so the notification is sent in the background (the bridge
          server is not up yet, and awaiting it would block the launch).
        - ``_run_turn_bg`` on the first turn, as a fallback for sessions whose
          terminal was launched outside the runner terminal route — including
          UI-launched terminals, which are never pre-warmed. Here Claude Code
          has already listed its tools, so the relayed tools land a beat late;
          the caller passes ``await_notify=False`` anyway, because a fresh
          UI-launched terminal's bridge has not published ``server.json`` yet
          and awaiting delivery would stall the turn ~15s on the readiness
          poll. The notification fires in the background instead.

        Relay-start failures are logged and swallowed: the relay is additive,
        and a failed socket bind or file write must never break the terminal
        launch or the turn that triggered it.

        :param bridge_id: Opaque bridge id resolved by the caller, e.g.
            ``"bridge_abc123"``. ``None`` resolves it from the session labels

        * ``message`` (default) with ``stream=false``: starts a
          background turn task and returns 202; events flow
          through ``GET /v1/sessions/{conv}/stream``.
        * ``message`` with ``stream=true``: returns a
          :class:`StreamingResponse` whose body IS the SSE event
          stream. Used by the harness HTTP client which consumes
          the SSE body synchronously for the ``response.created``
          → dispatch → pairing buffer flow.
        * ``interrupt`` / ``tool_result`` / ``approval``: control
          events forwarded to the harness verbatim. ``stream``
          is ignored for these types.

        :param conversation_id: AP-allocated conversation id from
            the URL path, e.g. ``"conv_abc123"``.
        :param request: The FastAPI request; we read its JSON body
            for type-discriminated dispatch.
        :param stream: When ``True`` and ``type == "message"``,
            return a streaming SSE response instead of 202.
            Defaults to ``False``.
        :returns: Either 202 JSON (fire-and-forget), a
            :class:`StreamingResponse` (``stream=true``), or the
            forwarded harness response (control events). 501 when
            no :class:`HarnessProcessManager` is wired up.

        agent.  It switches the session onto the new agent's os_env while
        preserving the workspace files:

        1. Closes the session's terminals via
           :func:`_teardown_session_terminals`, publishing
           ``session.resource.deleted`` for each so connected clients
           drop them (without the events the web UI keeps showing the
           old agent's dead terminal), then closes the primary OSEnv via
           :meth:`SessionResourceRegistry.cleanup_session` (workspace
           files are preserved).  The primary env re-materializes lazily
           on the next access from the new agent's spec, so the new
           ``os_env`` / sandbox / fork policy take effect while ``cwd``
           stays pinned to the same runner workspace.
        2. Drops the spec-derived session caches so the next access
           re-resolves the new agent.  The web filesystem/shell endpoints
           build the primary env from ``_session_spec_cache`` (keyed via
           ``_session_snapshot_cache``'s ``agent_id``); without dropping
           these the env would just rebuild from the STALE old spec and
           the new sandbox would never apply (a cross-agent sandbox
           leak).  Mirrors the turn-path switch reset.

        ``_session_agent_ids`` is deliberately left intact so the next
        turn still detects the switch and cold-starts the new harness
        subprocess.  This is a separate endpoint from
        ``DELETE /resources`` so the session-deletion contract (which
        also closes resources but never needs the switch-specific cache
        reset) is untouched.
