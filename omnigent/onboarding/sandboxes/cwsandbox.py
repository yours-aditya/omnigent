"""
CoreWeave Sandbox launcher.

Implements :class:`SandboxLauncher` for `CoreWeave Sandbox
<https://docs.coreweave.com/products/sandboxes>`_ on top of the official
``cwsandbox`` Python SDK. Same posture as the Modal and Daytona
launchers: the SDK is an optional dependency (``pip install
'omnigent[cwsandbox]'``) imported lazily, so the provider can be listed
and the module probed without it.

Supports both server-managed hosts (``host_type="managed"`` sessions)
and the CLI bootstrap flow. The one unsupported primitive is
``forward_local_port``: CW Sandbox has no local→sandbox path, so the
Databricks App OAuth flow doesn't apply — managed hosts authenticate
with a server-minted launch token instead.

Notes that shape this launcher:

- Egress defaults to none on CW Sandbox, so :meth:`provision` requests
  ``egress_mode="internet"`` — a managed host must dial the server out.
- Lifetime is a single hard cap (``max_lifetime_seconds``); there is no
  idle auto-stop. The managed token TTL is set above the cap.
- Credentials and base URL come from the SDK's own env vars
  (``CWSANDBOX_API_KEY`` / ``CWSANDBOX_BASE_URL``), 12-factor.
