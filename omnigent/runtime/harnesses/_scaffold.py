"""
:class:`HarnessApp` scaffold — base class every per-harness wrap
inherits.

The scaffold owns the boilerplate every harness needs:

- A FastAPI app exposing the harness API subset
  (POST /v1/sessions/{conversation_id}/events for the discriminated
  downward-event surface, GET /health). See
  ``designs/SERVER_HARNESS_CONTRACT.md`` §The Harness API Subset
  and ``designs/session_rearchitecture.md`` §3.
- Per-turn in-memory state: dicts of Futures the event handlers
  resolve when a ``tool_result`` event (tool output) or
  ``approval`` event (elicitation reply) arrives. Layer 2
  (per-turn) and Layer 3 (per-tool-dispatch) bookkeeping per
  §Harness in-memory state.
- Heartbeat emitter at :data:`_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S` cadence.
- Cancellation event set by an ``interrupt`` event — the
  per-harness ``run_turn`` should poll it before each LLM
  iteration / native tool call.
- In-band routing for steering: a ``message`` event with
  ``previous_response_id`` matching the in-flight turn becomes
  an injection rather than starting a new turn (also covers
  async function-call completions).
- Graceful SIGTERM / SIGINT handling: cancel the in-flight turn,
  drain pending tool results for a short grace window, then shut
  down the FastAPI app.

A subclass implements just two things: an ``async def run_turn(
request, ctx) -> None`` method that runs the LLM-tool loop using
``ctx`` to interact with upstream, and a ``create_app()``-style
free function that instantiates the subclass and returns its
FastAPI app for the runner to serve.

class MessageEvent(BaseModel):

    Downward ``message`` event — start a new turn or steer an in-flight one.

    A ``message`` arriving while no turn is in flight starts a fresh
    turn (the scaffold allocates a ``response_id`` and runs
    ``run_turn``). A ``message`` arriving while a turn is in flight
    is enqueued onto that turn's injection queue (the harness
    delivers it to ``run_turn`` via :meth:`TurnContext.next_injection`).
    The harness has at most one in-flight turn per conversation, so
    no explicit turn id is needed on the wire.

    Extra fields are accepted (``model_config = extra="allow"``) so
    the runner can pass through optional knobs that
    :class:`CreateResponseRequest` understands (``instructions``,
    ``conversation``, ``reasoning``, ``context_management``,
    ``tools``, ignored-but-tolerated controls like ``temperature``)
    without forcing this schema to mirror every field individually.

    :param type: Event discriminator; always ``"message"``.
    :param role: Always ``"user"`` for downward messages — assistant
        messages flow upward via the runner→server persistence
        channel, not through this endpoint. Constrained at the
        type level so a stray ``role: "assistant"`` POST fails 422
        rather than silently starting a turn with bad provenance.
    :param content: The message body. Either a plain string
        shorthand (converted to a single ``input_text`` block on
        the way to ``run_turn``) or a list of content blocks,
        e.g. ``[{"type": "input_text", "text": "Hello"}]``.

        in the conversation thread. The scaffold today uses a

          calls) is never killed — only one that emits nothing for the
          whole window. This replaces the prior fixed *cumulative* cap,
          which guillotined long-but-healthy turns mid-stream.
        - ABSOLUTE (:data:`_TURN_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT_S`): a hard ceiling on
          total duration, never rescheduled. Backstops the idle watchdog
          against a runaway-but-active loop the idle one never sees as
          stuck.
