# Omnigent on Islo

[Islo](https://islo.dev) sandboxes give you disposable cloud machines for
running Omnigent hosts, two ways:

- **CLI-launched**: `omnigent sandbox create` / `connect` provisions a
  sandbox from your terminal, ships your local checkout into it, and
  registers it as a host with your server.
- **Server-managed**: the server provisions a sandbox automatically when
  a session is created with `"host_type": "managed"` and terminates it
  when the session is deleted.

Sandboxes boot from the official prebaked host image. The Islo launcher
uses the Islo Python SDK, installed with the optional `omnigent[islo]`
extra, and authenticates with an API key.

What makes Islo different from the other providers, and shapes the rest
of this guide:

- **A credential gateway.** Islo can inject LLM/API keys into a sandbox's
  outbound traffic at the network layer, so the raw key never reaches the
  sandbox process. This is a first-class, recommended path for model
  credentials (see [Model credentials](#model-credentials-llm-keys)) and
  has no equivalent on Modal or Daytona.
- **No local port forward.** Islo can't forward a sandbox→laptop callback
  port, so the interactive in-sandbox `omnigent login` / App OAuth step is
  skipped automatically (as on Modal and Daytona).
- **No lifetime cap.** Islo sandboxes run until deleted (like Daytona,
  unlike Modal's 24 h).

## Prerequisites

Install Omnigent with the Islo extra, install the
[Islo CLI](https://docs.islo.dev), and create an API key. Make the key
available where the launcher runs — your shell for the CLI flow, the
**server** process for managed sandboxes:

```bash
pip install 'omnigent[islo]'                   # or: uv tool install 'omnigent[islo]'
curl -fsSL https://islo.dev/install.sh | sh   # install the islo CLI
islo login                                     # browser OAuth (one-time)
islo api-key create omnigent --show            # prints an islo_key_… value
export ISLO_API_KEY=islo_key_…
# Optional: a non-default API endpoint
# export ISLO_BASE_URL=https://api.islo.dev
```

`ISLO_API_KEY` is exchanged by the SDK for short-lived session tokens and
refreshed automatically. The key is the only required runtime credential;
no `~/.config` file is needed where the launcher runs.

> [!NOTE]
> **Islo cannot forward a local callback port into the sandbox.** The
> interactive `omnigent login` browser flow (and the in-sandbox App OAuth
> callback) needs a sandbox→laptop port forward, which Islo doesn't
> provide — so the CLI skips that step automatically, exactly as it does
> for Modal and Daytona. For a server that requires authentication, inject
> the credentials instead (see
> [Connecting to an authenticated server](#connecting-to-an-authenticated-server)).

## The host image

Sandboxes boot from `ghcr.io/omnigent-ai/omnigent-host:latest`, published
by CI from the `host` target of
[`deploy/docker/Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile) with Omnigent and its
dependencies preinstalled — including the coding-harness CLIs (`claude`,
`codex`, `pi`, `kiro-cli`), so agents on any harness run without an in-sandbox
install.

To use a different image (a fork, or extra tooling baked in), build the
same target and push it anywhere Islo can pull from:

```bash
docker build -f deploy/docker/Dockerfile --target host \
  --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest .
docker push docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest
```

Then point Omnigent at it — `OMNIGENT_ISLO_HOST_IMAGE` for the CLI flow,
or `sandbox.islo.image` in the server config for the managed flow. For a
private registry, configure the pull credentials on the Islo side (Islo
pulls the image, not Omnigent).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Native terminals need `bubblewrap`.** The `claude-native` /
> `codex-native` / `kiro-native` / `pi` harnesses wrap each agent terminal in a bubblewrap
> (`bwrap`) OS-sandbox, and on Linux that isolation is mandatory and
> fail-loud — a host image without the `bwrap` binary makes those terminals
> fail to start (`linux_bwrap sandbox requires the 'bwrap' binary on PATH`).
> The `host` Dockerfile target installs `bubblewrap`; if you bring your own
> image, install it there too. See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## CLI-launched sandboxes

Provision a sandbox and ship your local checkout into it:

```bash
omnigent sandbox create --provider islo --server https://your-host
```

This pulls the host image, builds wheels from your local checkout, and
overlays them on top — so the sandbox runs *your* code, not whatever the
image was built from. Then register it as a host with your server:

```bash
omnigent sandbox connect --provider islo \
  --sandbox-id <id-printed-by-create> \
  --server https://your-host
```

`connect` runs `omnigent host` inside the sandbox and holds the
connection open in your terminal — Ctrl-C tears it down. New sessions
targeting that host now run in the sandbox.

Running multiple sandboxes against one server? Pass a unique
`--host-name <label>` to each `connect` — the server keys hosts on
(owner, name), and sandboxes that share a hostname collide.

Sandboxes are disposable. When your code changes, create a new one — and
delete the old one (Islo sandboxes have no lifetime cap, so an abandoned
sandbox keeps billing until removed via `islo rm <id>` or the
[dashboard](https://app.islo.dev)).

### Live smoke checklist

Use this checklist before opening a provider-change PR, or when validating
a new Islo account/key. It assumes your Omnigent server is reachable from
Islo's cloud at `https://your-host` (for local testing, expose it with a
tunnel and use the public URL).

```bash
islo login
islo api-key create omnigent-smoke --show
export ISLO_API_KEY=islo_key_...
omnigent sandbox create --provider islo --server https://your-host
omnigent sandbox connect --provider islo \
  --sandbox-id <id-printed-by-create> \
  --server https://your-host
islo ls
islo rm <id-printed-by-create>
```

Expected result: `create` provisions the sandbox and ships wheels,
`connect` registers the host with the Omnigent server, `islo ls` shows the
sandbox while it exists, and `islo rm` deletes it. If `connect` cannot
reach the server, first verify the `--server` URL from a machine outside
your laptop network.

To inject LLM/git credentials into a CLI-launched sandbox, set
`OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV` in your shell to a comma-separated list of
variable names (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,GIT_TOKEN`) before running
`create` — the named variables are copied from your environment into the
sandbox at provision time. A listed name that is **not** set fails the
launch loudly (it would otherwise surface much later as an opaque harness
auth failure inside the sandbox).

### Connecting to an authenticated server

`connect` runs `omnigent host` inside the sandbox, and that host must
present credentials when it dials back to a server that requires
authentication. The interactive `omnigent login` browser flow can't run
inside an Islo sandbox (no callback port forward), so inject the keys for
the relevant server instead — name them in `OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV`
before `create`:

```bash
export OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV=DATABRICKS_HOST,DATABRICKS_TOKEN
omnigent sandbox create --provider islo
```

The in-sandbox host mints a fresh bearer token from those credentials on
every connect and reconnect. For a Databricks-fronted server, inject
`DATABRICKS_HOST` plus either `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` (a PAT) or
`DATABRICKS_CLIENT_ID` / `DATABRICKS_CLIENT_SECRET` (an OAuth service
principal — re-minting keeps a long-lived sandbox connected past any
single token's expiry).

A server with no authentication on the host tunnel needs none of this,
and neither do [server-managed sandboxes](#server-managed-sandboxes) —
those authenticate with a server-minted per-launch token automatically.

## Server-managed sandboxes

Add a `sandbox:` section to the server config (`omnigent server -c
config.yaml`, or `<data_dir>/config.yaml`):

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: islo
  server_url: https://your-host    # public URL sandboxes dial back to
```

`server_url` must be reachable *from Islo's cloud* — a public HTTPS URL,
not `localhost`. The server itself needs `ISLO_API_KEY` (and optional
`ISLO_BASE_URL`) in its environment. Sessions created with
`host_type: "managed"` (the API call or the Web UI's New Sandbox option)
then run on a fresh Islo sandbox; the create returns immediately and
provisioning happens in the background, exactly like the [Modal managed
flow](../modal/README.md#server-managed-sandboxes) — including repository
workspaces, the first-message rendezvous, and dead-sandbox relaunch.

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "agent_...", "host_type": "managed"}'
```

Each managed sandbox authenticates back with a server-minted, per-launch
token (7-day TTL — see [Lifecycle](#lifecycle-notes)); no user
credentials enter the sandbox for the server connection.

Managed Islo sandboxes pause after 15 idle minutes by default. When a new
message arrives for a session bound to an offline Islo-managed host,
Omnigent resumes the same sandbox id, mints a fresh launch token, and
restarts `omnigent host` against the existing workspace. Deleting the
session still deletes the sandbox.

### Managed hosts and server auth

How the dial-back authenticates depends on how the **server** does auth,
and there is one interaction worth knowing before you deploy. A managed
sandbox opens two kinds of connections back to the server:

- the **host tunnel** (`/v1/hosts/<id>/tunnel`), which the per-launch
  token authenticates directly — the server mints it, scopes it to one
  host, and resolves the owner from it. This always works.
- one **runner tunnel** per session (`/v1/runners/<token>/tunnel`), opened
  by the runner subprocess the host spawns. The runner authenticates with
  *whatever server credential it can resolve* — a proxy-injected identity
  (header / OIDC), or a stored `omnigent login` token (local hosts only; a
  fresh managed sandbox has none) — **not** the per-launch host token.

The consequence:

- **Header / OIDC-proxy auth, or single-user (no-auth) servers** — the
  runner tunnel needs no extra identity, so managed hosts work out of the
  box. **Verified end-to-end on a single-user server**: a session created
  with `host_type: "managed"` provisioned an Islo sandbox from the bwrap
  image, the launcher cleared the seeded `apiKeyHelper`, the host *and*
  runner tunnels connected, and a native Claude terminal ran on the
  injected `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` subscription.
- **The built-in `accounts` provider (`OMNIGENT_AUTH_ENABLED=1`)** — the
  runner tunnel additionally requires a *user* identity, which the
  per-launch host token does not carry, so the runner dial-back is refused
  (`403`) even though the host tunnel connects. This is a framework-level
  managed-host interaction shared by **all** sandbox providers (Modal /
  Daytona / Islo), not specific to Islo.

So for a managed Islo deployment, front the server with **header or OIDC
auth** (a reverse proxy / IdP injects the user identity on every request,
including the runner WebSocket — see
[`deploy/README.md#auth`](../README.md#auth)), or run it single-user. The
`accounts` provider is fine for CLI-launched hosts (you `omnigent login`,
and that token is what the in-sandbox host forwards), but not yet for the
managed runner dial-back.

Optional `islo:` settings:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: islo
  server_url: https://your-host
  islo:
    image: docker.io/<you>/omnigent-host:latest   # default: official image
    env: [OPENAI_API_KEY, GIT_TOKEN]               # copy from server env
    base_url: https://api.islo.dev                 # non-default API endpoint
    gateway_profile: default                       # Islo gateway for egress + credential injection
    snapshot_name: omnigent-host-snapshot          # optional named Islo snapshot
    workdir: /root/workspace                       # sandbox working directory
    vcpus: 2
    memory_mb: 4096
    disk_gb: 20
    idle_pause_after_s: 900                        # null disables idle pause
```

## Model credentials (LLM keys)

A fresh sandbox has no model credentials of your own. Islo offers **two
distinct ways** to give the agent a model — and they interact, so pick one
deliberately per harness.

### Option A — Islo gateway integration (recommended)

This is the Islo-native path with no Modal/Daytona equivalent. Islo
[gateways](https://docs.islo.dev/cli/gateways) "automatically attach API
keys, tokens, and secrets to outbound requests" at the **network layer** —
*"credentials never reach the sandbox process."* You connect a provider
once, server-side, and every sandbox picks it up:

```bash
islo login --tool claude     # OAuth-connect Anthropic (alias: --tool anthropic)
islo login --tool openai     # …and/or OpenAI
islo status                  # shows connected integrations
```

This is **not Claude-specific** — it's how Islo supplies model
credentials to *every* harness. Islo pre-seeds each sandbox with a
**phantom** placeholder key (`islo_phantom_…`) in whatever location the
harness reads, per provider:

| Harness | Phantom key location | Provider endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code (`claude-native`, `claude-sdk`, `pi`) | `apiKeyHelper` in `~/.claude/settings.json` | `api.anthropic.com` |
| Codex / OpenAI agents | `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var | `api.openai.com` |

The harness sends that placeholder to its provider endpoint; the gateway
intercepts the request and swaps it for your connected credential before
forwarding. The raw key never lands in the sandbox, and the connection is
team-wide — other members don't need their own. (We observed both phantom
keys pre-seeded in a single sandbox.)

These integrations connect **provider API keys** (per-token billing), not
plan/subscription auth — `--tool claude` gives an Anthropic API key, not a
Claude Pro/Max subscription; `--tool openai` gives an OpenAI API key, not
a ChatGPT plan. To use a subscription or plan token on any harness (a
Claude Pro/Max token, a Codex access token), use
[Option B](#option-b--omnigent-env-injection-your-own-key-or-a-subscription).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If `islo status` shows **"No integrations connected"** for a provider,
> its phantom key resolves to nothing — the harness falls back to a failing
> request (Claude reports "API Usage Billing" and retries). Connect the
> integration for each provider whose harness you use.

#### Path A under managed hosts

This is where the gateway shines: when the **server** launches sandboxes,
you configure **no model credential on the Omnigent side at all**. The
flow:

```
admin (once):  islo login --tool claude   → connects Anthropic to the Islo ACCOUNT
                                                              │
server ──ISLO_API_KEY──▶ Islo API "create sandbox" ──▶ sandbox under that account
                                                              │ Islo pre-seeds the
                                                              │ phantom apiKeyHelper
                                                              ▼
   agent's claude → api.anthropic.com (phantom key) ──▶ Islo gateway swaps in the real key
```

The Omnigent server only ever holds `ISLO_API_KEY` — the credential it
uses to *create* sandboxes. Because every managed sandbox is created under
that Islo account, and integrations are connected at the **account/team**
level, each one inherits the connected Claude credential through the
gateway automatically. The only Omnigent-side knob is which gateway a
managed sandbox uses:

```yaml
sandbox:
  provider: islo
  server_url: https://your-host
  islo:
    gateway_profile: default     # the Islo gateway carrying the connected integration
```

Two consequences worth internalizing:

- **No model secret lives in the Omnigent server's config or
  environment** — nothing to leak there. Contrast [Option B under managed
  hosts](#option-b--omnigent-env-injection-your-own-key-or-a-subscription),
  where the key sits in `sandbox.islo.env` (copied from the server's env
  into each sandbox).
- **The integration must be connected on the same Islo account the
  server's `ISLO_API_KEY` belongs to.** If your server runs under a
  dedicated service/CI Islo account, run `islo login --tool claude` while
  authenticated as *that* account — not a personal laptop login.

### Option B — Omnigent env injection (your own key or a subscription)

Bring your own credential by naming it in `OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV`
(CLI) or `sandbox.islo.env` (managed); the launcher copies the value from
the launching environment into the sandbox, and the in-sandbox host
forwards the standard harness credential vars to its runners:

| Variable | Enables |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Claude models on the Anthropic API |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | Anthropic-compatible gateways (LiteLLM, Bedrock/Vertex bridges, corporate proxies) |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` | claude-code with a Claude **subscription** (no API key) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | OpenAI or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenRouter, vLLM, Ollama, …) |
| `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN` | codex with a ChatGPT Business/Enterprise workspace |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Gemini on the Google AI API |

The full per-plan recipes (subscriptions, gateways, open-source models)
are identical to Modal — see the [variable table and
recipes](../modal/README.md#llm-credentials-for-managed-sandboxes). For a
Claude **subscription** specifically, run `claude setup-token` on your own
machine (one-time browser auth) and inject the resulting long-lived token
as `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. For env vars beyond the standard set, inject
`OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ENV_PASSTHROUGH=NAME1,NAME2`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Your injected Claude credential automatically wins over Islo's phantom
> helper.** Islo seeds an `apiKeyHelper` into every sandbox, and Claude Code
> would normally prefer it over a `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`/`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
> in the environment. So when you inject one of those, the Islo launcher
> strips the seeded `apiKeyHelper` at provision time — for **both**
> CLI-launched and server-managed sandboxes — leaving your credential as the
> sole auth path. No manual step, nothing to run inside the sandbox.

Codex/OpenAI needs nothing special either — its phantom is the
`OPENAI_API_KEY` env var, which your injected `OPENAI_API_KEY` simply
overrides.

### Choosing between A and B

| | Option A — gateway | Option B — env injection |
|---|---|---|
| Credential | provider **API key** (Anthropic, OpenAI, …) | your API key **or** subscription/plan token |
| Billing | per-token API | API key, or your subscription/plan |
| Key in sandbox? | **No** (gateway injects out-of-band) | Yes (in the sandbox env) |
| Scope | account/team-wide, all sandboxes | per-sandbox |
| Managed-host config | just `gateway_profile`; no secret on server | key in `sandbox.islo.env` |
| Best for | **managed / production**, API-key billing | your own **subscription** or key; CLI or managed |
| Catch | needs a connected integration | the injected var must be set where the launcher runs |

Pick **one per harness** — connect Islo's integration *or* inject your own
credential, never both. Both work in either launch flow: the launcher
strips Islo's seeded `apiKeyHelper` automatically when you inject a Claude
credential. The same two patterns apply to Codex/OpenAI (`islo login --tool
openai`, or inject `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `CODEX_ACCESS_TOKEN`).

### Git credentials (private repositories)

Inject an HTTPS token as `GIT_TOKEN` (GitLab: add `GIT_USERNAME=oauth2`)
via `OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV` / `sandbox.islo.env`. The host image's git
credential helper answers HTTPS auth from it for both the launch-time
clone and the agent's later `fetch` / `push`, writing nothing to disk. Use
HTTPS repository URLs. Details by provider match the [Modal git
guide](../modal/README.md#git-credentials-private-repositories).

## Security considerations

- **Path A keeps the model key out of the sandbox — a real advantage.**
  With the gateway, the agent process only ever sees the phantom
  placeholder; the real key is injected at Islo's network edge. A
  prompt-injected or compromised agent can't exfiltrate a key it never
  holds. This is the strongest credential posture of the three providers
  for model keys, and the reason to prefer Option A where API-key billing
  is acceptable.
- **The gateway terminates TLS to inject.** Credential injection means
  Islo's gateway sits in the path of the agent's outbound LLM traffic and
  re-originates it — so that traffic (prompts, completions, tool output
  sent to the model) is visible at Islo's edge. Acceptable for most teams,
  but weigh it for highly sensitive workloads, and scope the
  `gateway_profile` to exactly the egress you intend.
- **Option B puts the key in the sandbox.** A subscription token or API key
  named in `sandbox.islo.env` is copied into the sandbox environment at
  provision time and lives there for the sandbox's life. Prefer scoped,
  short-lived credentials, and rely on the per-terminal `bwrap` sandbox
  (below) to keep the agent away from it.
- **The agent terminal is sandboxed away from those secrets.** Native
  harness terminals run under a bubblewrap OS-sandbox that masks dotfiles
  (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, the injected `~/.omnigent` server token) and pins
  the agent to its workspace — defense-in-depth *inside* the Islo sandbox,
  independent of Islo's own isolation. This is why the image must ship
  `bwrap` (see [the host image](#the-host-image)).
- **All managed sandboxes share one Islo org + `ISLO_API_KEY`.**
  Cross-user isolation rides on Islo's sandbox boundaries, and the shared
  org key can enumerate and delete any sandbox — the same single-tenant-org
  shape as the Modal and Daytona providers. Scope the org to this workload.
- **The launch token's lifetime is 7 days.** Islo sandboxes have no
  platform lifetime cap, so the per-launch host token must outlive a
  long-running sandbox across reconnects (a longer replay window than
  Modal's ~24 h; same as Daytona). A relaunch mints a fresh one.

## Lifecycle notes

- **No platform lifetime cap.** Unlike Modal's 24-hour limit, Islo
  sandboxes run until deleted. The managed flow deletes a sandbox when its
  session is deleted, and the dead-sandbox relaunch path replaces one that
  crashed or was removed out-of-band. CLI-launched sandboxes you delete
  yourself (`islo rm <id>`).
- **Resources.** Sandboxes default to 2 vCPUs and 4 GiB of memory;
  override per managed launch with `vcpus` / `memory_mb` / `disk_gb`.
- **Snapshots.** Set `sandbox.islo.snapshot_name` to boot from a named
  Islo snapshot instead of the configured image.
- **Idle pause.** Server-managed Islo sandboxes pause after 15 idle
  minutes by default (`idle_pause_after_s: 900`). Set
  `idle_pause_after_s: null` to opt out and manage sandbox lifetime
  yourself. The policy is set when the sandbox is created, so changing it
  affects new managed sandboxes, not existing ones. This uses Islo's
  pause/resume lifecycle because the workspace survives and Omnigent can
  wake it on the next message. Daytona's 15-minute provider default is
  disabled in Omnigent instead, because Daytona auto-stop would otherwise
  kill the host between turns.
- **Managed resume.** Paused or stopped server-managed Islo sandboxes can
  resume in place under the same sandbox id and workspace. Session delete
  still deletes the sandbox. This resume path is what wakes a 15-minute
  idle-paused host on the next message.
- **Provider-side lifecycle** (list / status / delete / stop) — use the
  `islo` CLI (`islo ls`, `islo rm <id>`) or the
  [dashboard](https://app.islo.dev) directly.

## Cost

Islo bills usage with no seat licenses or idle fees: ~$0.07/CPU-hour,
~$0.04/GB-hour of memory, ~$0.0007/GB-hour of disk — about $0.25/hour for
the default 2 vCPU / 4 GiB sandbox while it runs. New accounts get $50 of
free credits. Rates: [islo.dev](https://islo.dev).

## Troubleshooting

- **Native Claude/Codex terminal fails with `linux_bwrap sandbox requires
  the 'bwrap' binary on PATH`.** The native harnesses wrap each agent
  terminal in a bubblewrap OS-sandbox; the host image must ship
  `bubblewrap`. The `host` Dockerfile target installs it — rebuild from a
  current image, or for a one-off on a CLI-launched sandbox run
  `apt-get install -y bubblewrap` inside it.
- **Claude shows "API Usage Billing" / "both `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` and
  `apiKeyHelper` set."** You injected your own Claude credential (Option B)
  but Islo's phantom `apiKeyHelper` is still present — the launcher strips it
  automatically at provision, so this means the strip didn't run: confirm the
  credential is named in `OMNIGENT_ISLO_SANDBOX_ENV` / `sandbox.islo.env` (the
  signal the launcher keys on), and check the provision log for the
  "clearing Islo's seeded apiKeyHelper" line.
- **Requests retry then fail with no obvious error.** `islo status` shows
  no connected integration, so the phantom `apiKeyHelper` resolves to
  nothing. Connect one (Option A) or switch to Option B.
- **"managed host did not come online within 120s."** Check that
  `server_url` is publicly reachable from Islo's cloud, then inspect the
  in-sandbox host log: `~/.omnigent/logs/host-runner/*.log`.
- **Agent has no credentials.** Verify the injected var names match the
  forwarded set above (or are named in `OMNIGENT_RUNNER_ENV_PASSTHROUGH`),
  and that each name was actually set in the launching environment.

## Environment variable reference
